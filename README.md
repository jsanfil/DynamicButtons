# DynamicButtons
This project was an experiment to understand a couple concepts
1. How to create a ScrollView with a stack view inside
2. Add a dynamic set of buttons with images and text to the scroll view. The number of buttons is not known at compile time, so they need to be added programatically.
3. Figure out how to change the color of the buttons programatically. The colors toggle as they are clicked on and off essentially acting like check boxes.
4. Understand how to find a set of buttons at runtime based on a custom class.
